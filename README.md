### Paper Analysis

My analysis of deep learning papers along with an implementation in tensorflow. 
I analyzed these papers by contextualizing the core machine learning and deep learning concepts that were used. For example, I explain things like probabalistic interpretations of ML algorithms, maximum likelihood estimation, and ML concepts such as SGD. I then explain how the tougher concept in the papers can be seen as building upon these blocks. 
My goal in doing this is for me to better understand recent papers and get better with tensorflow, as well as to show that deep learning research can be understood through understanding the core concepts.
